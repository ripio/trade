### Ripio Trade - WebSocket Checksum Hash

This example serves as a guide for generating checksum hashes for order book WebSocket messages. Itâ€™s essential that the checksum is generated consistently to ensure reliable comparison with the checksum received from the WebSocket messages.

Assuming the order book is received in the following format:

```
{
  "body": {
    "asks": [
      {
        "amount": "0.002239",
        "price": "63721.68"
      }
    ],
    "bids": [
      {
        "amount": "0.000843",
        "price": "63598.18"
      }
    ],
    "hash": "12878522183081097146",
    "pair": "BTC_USDC"
  },
  "id": 2440342293,
  "timestamp": 1727719367437,
  "topic": "orderbook/level_2@BTC_USDC"
}
```

The following logic can be used to generate the checksum hash:

* Start with the top 10 bid orders (or fewer if there are less than 10);
* For each price and amount:
    * Remove any decimal points;
    * Eliminate leading zeros;
    * Concatenate the price and amount as a string;
* Aggregate the results for the top 10 bids (from highest to lowest price), if there are fewer than 10 orders, use whatever is available;
* Repeat the process for the top 10 ask orders (from lowest to highest price);
* Concatenate the results from both bids and asks;
* Calculate the checksum hash for the combined string;
* If your CRC32 library produces a leading zero, remove it before comparing;
* A checksum value of zero indicates that there are no bids or asks in the order book (which is unlikely);
